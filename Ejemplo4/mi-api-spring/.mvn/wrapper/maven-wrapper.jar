The file `maven-wrapper.jar` is a binary file that is part of the Maven Wrapper. It is not a text file and does not contain human-readable code. Instead, it contains compiled Java bytecode. 

This file is automatically generated when you initialize a new Maven project with the Maven Wrapper. It is not meant to be manually edited or read. 

Therefore, I cannot provide the contents of this file as it is not a text-based file. It is a binary file that contains compiled Java code.
